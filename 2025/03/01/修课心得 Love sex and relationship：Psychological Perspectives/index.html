<p>节选部分如下：</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> </p>
<p>Background of Study</p>
<p>Sexual activity plays a pivotal role in romantic relationships, yet research on its impact in young adults remains limited. Sharon Sassler and Fenaba R. Addo’s (2012) study on 600 low-to-moderate-income couples revealed that over one-third engaged in early sexual activity, correlating with lower relationship quality, especially for women. Brian J. Willoughby and Dean M. Busby’s (2014) separate study supported this conclusion, indicating a decrease in the quality of relationships with early sexual involvement.</p>
<p>Norval Glenn (2003) highlighted the emotional complexities of early sexual involvement, making it challenging to end unhealthy relationships. S. K. Whitbourne (2012) suggested that early sexual activity may foster commitment, leading to the persistence of suboptimal relationships.</p>
<p>Jason S. Carroll’s (2014) perspective emphasizes the importance of early sexual behavior in testing sexual compatibility for long-term relationships. However, previous studies, characterized by sample homogeneity and small sizes, may limit the detection of significant relationships between variables.</p>
<p>Cultural differences, as explored by Silvia Ubillos, Darío Paez, and José Luis González (2000), contribute to variations in sexual behavior. The study revealed associations between social and cultural variables, religious aspects, and sexual permissiveness. Moreover, socio-economic development and cultural dimensions play a crucial role in sexual frequency, challenging stereotypes about Christianism and oriental religions. This research provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of early sexual activity, cultural influences, and relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>Significance of study:<br>Today, characterized by evolving relationship dynamics, premature sexual behavior in young adult relationships is prevalent. Approximately 50% of young couples engage in sexual activity before commitment (Sassler &amp; Kamp Dush, 2009). Despite this trend, there is limited research on early sex. This study contributes to understanding modern romantic relationships, offering insights into evolving concepts of love, interpersonal relationships, and mental health. The findings may inform comprehensive sex education, interventions, and policies addressing sexually transmitted diseases and societal issues. </p>
<p><strong>Research questions and Hypothesis</strong><br>Research questions How does sex before or early in a relationship affect the intimate relationships of the younger generation? </p>
<p>Hypothesis<br>Main hypothesis: There is a negative relationship between early sex and the quality as well as length of intimate relationships.<br>Sub-hypothesis #1: People with different cultural backgrounds are influenced differently in the length and quality of the relationship from the sex before or early in relationship.<br>Sub-hypothesis #2: Having sex before or early in a relationship can establish trust and intimacy immediately.<br>Sub-hypothesis #3: People having early sex before a relationship is established have a higher chance of cheating.</p>
<p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>
<p>Participants:<br>Approximately 100 individuals aged 18 to 35 from diverse backgrounds (Eastern &amp; Western countries) will be recruited for our study on the impact of early sexual activity in intimate relationships. Out of these, 65 will participate in the survey, and 5 will be selected for interviews. Participants must have experienced sex in a relationship, with a distribution of 60% having had sex before the relationship and 40% not.</p>
<p>Recruitment:<br>A mixed-method recruitment approach will be employed, combining social media and traditional methods. Flyers and physical questionnaires will be distributed in schools, and online surveys will be shared through a dedicated page link. Social media platforms will be utilized, emphasizing hashtags related to youth, relationships, and early sex. Recruitment materials will highlight the voluntary and confidential nature of participation, eligibility criteria, and researcher contact information.And for interview, acquaintances with relevant experiences or knowledge in psychology and social behavior will be selected for interviews. Incentives will be provided to encourage questionnaire completers to participate in interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Measures</strong></p>
<p>Measurement of Independent Variables (IV):</p>
<p>Early Sex: We assess the timing of early sexual activity by asking participants about the occurrence of sexual activities within one week of establishing a relationship.</p>
<p>Cultural Background: To capture participants’ cultural influences, we utilize questions from established scales such as the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) and Cultural Orientation Scale (COS) by Bierbrauer, Meyer, and Wolfradt.</p>
<p>Measurement of Dependent Variables (DV) and Relationship Features:</p>
<p>Quality and Length of Romantic Relationship: Using specific questions from the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) by Graham Spanier, we measure the quality and duration of romantic relationships. Opening questions explore relationship dynamics, focusing on factors influencing length.</p>
<p>Quick Trust and Intimacy: We gauge trust and intimacy through questions from the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR) by Brennan, Clark, and Shaver. Adjustments are made to dimensions of avoidance and anxiety, with a focus on early relationship stages to minimize recall bias.</p>
<p>Cheating: Likelihood of infidelity is measured using questions from the Infidelity Questionnaire by Blow and Hartnett, allowing exploration of the potential for cheating in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Data Collection Procedures<br>We employ a dual approach, utilizing a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The survey, consisting of 15-20 questions, takes approximately 10 minutes for participants to complete anonymously on a website. This questionnaire will be divided into sections. And participants have the option to express interest in an in-depth interview. Interviews, conducted in a semi-structured format, align with the questionnaire outline, focusing on characteristics influenced by sexual behavior since relationship inception. And we will focus on the special outcome of the interviewees in questionnaire.<br>After survey and interviews, we meticulously structured and cleaned the data, categorizing participants into two groups based on early sexual behavior (1 for early sex, 0 for no early sex) for comparison. For those engaging in early sex, we analyzed cultural background scores, categorizing them by cultural region if scores were “moderately correlated” or higher.<br>Next, we analyzed questionnaire Section 2 scores on relationship quality, length, trust, intimacy, and cheating separately for both groups. Correlation analysis and statistical tests (t-tests or ANOVA) were applied to test main hypotheses and Hypotheses 2 and 3, ensuring accuracy.<br>Data visualization methods, including tables and bar charts, were used to compare the impact of early sex on relationship quality and length across different cultures, validating Hypothesis 1.<br>For opening questions, a thematic analysis identified recurring themes and patterns. Keywords were extracted and frequency counted to examine the relationship between early sex and relationship length commitment.<br>Interview transcripts were re-recorded and organized. Thematic analysis explored responses’ depth, revising the survey-based model based on interview insights.</p>
<p><strong>RESULT</strong></p>
<p>問卷訪談結果與分析略</p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<p>For the quality of relationship. Groups that have engaged in early sex have far more regrets and arguments in their relationships than those that have not. This is because, due to the “sexual chemistry” reaction is short-term temporary, so after a period of time after the incompatibility of both parties will be exposed, this kind of feelings do not have a long-term basis for accumulation, so both parties are prone to feelings of regret. Surprisingly, in terms of future expectations, those who continued to have early sex had higher expectations of the future because they viewed sex as a manifestation of high development stage of the relationship. Their own early involvement in sex suggests that they are more satisfied with each other in terms of physical attraction. This leads to higher levels of satisfaction with physical contact.</p>
<p>The challenge in sustaining relationships with early sexual behavior stems from several factors. Primarily, such unions rely heavily on passion, bypassing crucial stages of intimacy and trust development, making them prone to disputes and eventual dissolution. Engaging in early sexual behavior often raises expectations, magnifying negative aspects upon reality’s arrival. Despite assumptions of swift termination, these relationships persist due to societal and individual views of sex as a commitment, leading to endurance to avoid guilt or societal judgment. Post-coital experiences may foster unrealistic fantasies, obscuring potential compatibility issues. Influenced by the moment’s intensity, individuals may inaccurately perceive compatibility. Nevertheless, lacking careful consideration, these relationships succumb to inherent deficiencies, highlighting their transient nature.</p>
<p>Empirical data supports sub-hypothesis#1, indicating that early sexual behavior significantly affects romantic relationships, especially in East Asian societies and to a lesser extent in other cultures. East Asian societies, more family-oriented, devalue future romantic connections linked to early sex, subjecting love relationships to strict social control. This societal influence fosters reluctance to end relationships, resulting in gradual deterioration. In the Middle East, influenced by religious conservatism like East Asia, relationship quality suffers from cultural and social controls despite the absence of early sexual engagement. European and American cultures, with lenient moral norms, do not prolong troubled relationships due to early sexual behavior, and romantic progress remains unaffected. South Asian and Latin American cultures, with an intermediate cultural climate, have fewer social limitations regarding sex compared to other cultures.<br>For sub-hypothesis#2, early sexual behavior in a relationship does not necessarily foster quick trust and intimacy. While commitment is crucial, sexual commitment differs from overall relationship commitment. Rapid sexual development may cause neglect of other relationship aspects, hindering emotional depth and communication and the trust as well as intimacy are based on time accumulated. Quick progression might lead to a perception that feelings are solely passion-driven, raising suspicions about loyalty, and diminishing trust between partners.</p>
<p>Sub-hypothesis 3 establishes a significant link between early sexual engagement in relationships and a higher likelihood of infidelity. This correlation is attributed to reduced guilt and increased susceptibility to “emotional” motivations in those engaging in early sex. The accelerated onset of early sexual behavior may lead to a lack of mutual awareness, revealing value disparities that spark conflicts and potential relationship deviations. Individuals engaging in early sexual behavior may be driven by a heightened interest in sex, a diminished sense of responsibility, and a perception of sex as pleasure rather than a commitment expression, making them more prone to novel experiences. Alternatively, lower satisfaction and stability, combined with inadequate knowledge of partners, may elevate dissatisfaction and incline individuals towards extramarital affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This study examined the effects of early sexual behavior on the quality and stability of romantic relationships. The results showed that early sexual behavior was associated with lower relationship satisfaction, higher conflict, lower trust, higher infidelity, and higher breakup rates. These effects varied across different cultural contexts, with East Asian cultures being more negatively affected than others. The study suggested that early sexual behavior might hinder the development of intimacy and commitment, and increase the risk of relationship dissolution.<br>Enlightens:<br>The study advocates reducing early sexual engagement, emphasizing the distinction between sexual and relationship commitment. In other words, we should also balance the physical attraction with emotional connection in Relationships. Despite discouraging early sex, it calls for a nuanced perspective on sexuality in relationships, highlighting the need to address cultural biases and societal perceptions to safeguard relationship integrity.<br>Study limitations<br>The study’s scope, conducted in Hong Kong, may have been influenced by its cultural context, limiting generalizability. The focus on East Asian culture could introduce bias, and gender differences were not adequately considered in the sub-hypotheses’ statistical analyses. Future research should address these limitations for a more comprehensive understanding.</p>
